Hi! I'm Yuyang, a 4th year PhD student jointly supervised by [Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/), [Yee Whye Teh](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/) and [Tom Rainforth](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~twgr/). 

I am interested in probabilistic and statistical methodologies in machine learning. My current research interests include probabilistic generative models, variational inference, and Monte Carlo methods. 

Before starting my PhD, I completed a Master of Mathematics at University of Oxford.
